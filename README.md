# Headings and Footers
## What I learned/Practice
This assignment as focused on using headings and footers as well as talking about a topic we were interested in. So, of course, I wrote mine on the hit block buster movie of summer 2023, Barbie. I also reused the same navbar is worked on in Inputs and Displays. 

### Heading and Footers
I had been using headings and footers for the majority of my projects, but after this assignment I felt i had a better understand of how to trouble shoot it when it was not working. I learned that you can select the entire web page in CSS by using the ```*``` selector. You can then use this to set the full width to 100%. This will help fix any problem occuring if the background of the header does not reach each end of the web page completely.   \
I also learned adding the respective ```top; 0``` or ```bottom; 0``` are is the best way to make the header and footer stay at their respective locations.
